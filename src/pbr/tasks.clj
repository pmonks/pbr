  "Standard implementations of common tools.build tasks.

  The following build task functions are provided, with the
  specified required and optional hash map options:

  deploy-info    -- opt: :deploy-info-file (defaults to \"./resources/deploy-info.edn\")
  check-release  -- as for the release task --
  release        -- req: :lib a symbol identifying your project e.g. 'org.github.pmonks/pbr
                         :version a string containing the version of your project e.g. \"1.0.0-SNAPSHOT\"
                    opt: :dev-branch the name of the development branch containing the changes to be PRed (defaults to \"dev\")
                         :prod-branch the name of the production branch where the PR is to be sent (defaults to \"main\")
                         :pr-desc a format string used for the PR description with two %s values passed in (%1$s = lib, %2$s = version) (defaults to \"%1$s release v%2$s. See commit log for details of what's included in this release.\")
