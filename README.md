# PBR - Peter's Build Resources

A little [tools.build](https://github.com/clojure/tools.build) task library and turnkey build script that supports the author's personal GitHub workflow.  It is not expected to be especially relevant for other developers' workflows, except perhaps as a model for how tools.build can be (somewhat) tamed when working with multiple independent projects that share common build tasks.

## Why?

Because "vanilla" tools.build builds impose a _lot_ of unnecessary repetition when one is working on lots of separate projects that have the same build tasks. A more detailed explanation of the problem is [here](https://ask.clojure.org/index.php/11168/tools-build-are-standard-build-tasks-under-consideration).

## Features

### Task library

PBR includes a library of tools.build tasks that are [documented here](https://pmonks.github.io/pbr/).  These may be used independently of the turnkey build script described next.

### Turnkey build script

PBR also provides a turnkey `build.clj` script that provides all of the tasks I typically need in my build scripts.  It allows customisation via a per-project `pbr.clj` file, which must contain a `set-opts` fn where various project specific options can be set.  You can look at [PBR's own `pbr.clj` file](https://github.com/pmonks/pbr/blob/main/pbr.clj) for an idea of what this looks like.

Tasks can be listed by running `clojure -A:deps -T:build help/doc`, and are:

* `check` - Check the code by AOT compiling it (and throwing away the result).
* `check-asf-policy` - Checks this project's dependencies' licenses against the ASF's 3rd party license policy (https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html).
* `check-release` - Check that a release can be done from the current directory.
* `ci` - Run the CI pipeline.
* `clean` - Clean up the project.
* `deploy` - Deploys the library JAR to Clojars.
* `docs` - Generates documentation (using codox).
* `eastwood` - Run the eastwood linter.
* `install` - Install the library locally e.g. so it can be tested by downstream dependencies
* `jar` - Generates a library JAR for the project.
* `kondo` - Run the clj-kondo linter.
* `licenses` - Attempts to list all licenses for the transitive set of dependencies of the project, as SPDX license identifiers.
* `lint` - Run all linters.
* `nvd` - Run an NVD vulnerability check.
* `outdated` - Check for outdated dependencies (using antq).
* `pom` - Generates a comprehensive pom.xml for the project.
* `release` - Release a new version of the library.
* `test` - Run the tests.
* `uber` - Create an uber jar.
* `uberexec` - Creates an executable uber jar. NOTE: does not bundle a JRE, though one is still required.
* `upgrade` - Upgrade any outdated dependencies (using antq). NOTE: does not prompt for confirmation!

#### deps.edn required by turnkey build script

To use the turnkey build script, include the following alias in your project's `deps.edn`:

```edn
{:deps { ; Your project's dependencies
       }
 :aliases {:build {:deps        {io.github.seancorfield/build-clj {:git/tag "v0.8.2" :git/sha "0ffdb4c"}
                                 com.github.pmonks/pbr            {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}
                   :ns-default  pbr.build
                   :extra-paths ["src"]}}}  ; To appease codox, which is poorly integrated with tools.deps/tools.build...
```

Note that despite not using it directly, you must express an explicit dependency on `io.github.seancorfield/build-clj` in your build alias, as that project [doesn't publish artifacts to Clojars](https://github.com/seancorfield/build-clj/issues/11) and transitive git coordinate dependencies are not supported by tools.deps.

#### Preparing to build with the turnkey build script

To prepare your project to use the turnkey build script, you must run the following command first:

```shell
$ clj -A:build -P
```

## FAQ

[//]: # (Comment: Every Question in this list has two spaces at the end THAT MUST NOT BE REMOVED!!)

**Q.** Why "PBR"?  
**A.** Because this code is cheap and nasty, and will give you a headache if you consume too much of it.

**Q.** Does PBR use itself for build tasks?  
**A.** Yes it does!  [You can see this sneaky self-reference here](https://github.com/pmonks/pbr/blob/main/deps.edn#L35).

### Developer Workflow

This project uses the [git-flow branching strategy](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), with the caveat that the permanent branches are called `main` and `dev`, and any changes to the `main` branch are considered a release and auto-deployed (JARs to Clojars, API docs to GitHub Pages, etc.).

For this reason, **all development must occur either in branch `dev`, or (preferably) in temporary branches off of `dev`.**  All PRs from forked repos must also be submitted against `dev`; the `main` branch is **only** updated from `dev` via PRs created by the core development team.  All other changes submitted to `main` will be rejected.

### Build Tasks

`pbr` uses [`tools.build`](https://clojure.org/guides/tools_build). You can get a list of available tasks by running:

```
clojure -A:deps -T:build help/doc
```

Of particular interest are:

* `clojure -T:build test` - run the unit tests
* `clojure -T:build lint` - run the linters (clj-kondo and eastwood)
* `clojure -T:build ci` - run the full CI suite (check for outdated dependencies, run the unit tests, run the linters)
* `clojure -T:build install` - build the JAR and install it locally (e.g. so you can test it with downstream code)

Please note that the `deploy` task is restricted to the core development team (and will not function if you run it yourself).
